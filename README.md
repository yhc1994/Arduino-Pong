# Arduino-Pong
A simple Pong game controlled by 3D Accelerometer

Pong is an ancient game released in 1972 by the famous video game manufacture Atari. The designer is Alan Alcorn, who created the initial version as the training exercise assigned by the co-founder of Atari, Nolan Bushnell. The first Pong game was carried in Magnavox Odyssey and has been updated to multi different versions. The integral game system, which was put inside a wooden box was popular in the pubs and spread widely and quickly. The Pong game of Atari brought huge commercial benefit to the company and broaden the video game market. 

The Pong game is a two-dimensional Ping pong simulating game. The players move the vertical paddles up located in left or right screen by rotating the rotary knobs. The ball will be rebounded after touching the paddles. If the paddle does not catch the ball, the other player can score one point. The player who wins the 11 scores first can win the game. 

The main aim of the project is to design and create the similar Pong game system based on the LED matrix and 3D accelerometers.

The corresponding objectives include:

•	Use the LED matrix to display the paddles and moving ball simultaneously;

•	Use two 3D accelerometers to transfer the different motion of hand to the motion of the paddles on LED matrix;

•	Use Bluetooth shield to send game scores and result to remote phone;

•	Design another operating method with the pushbuttons to control the starting of the game and the motion of the paddles.

•	Use interrupt in the pushbutton functions to control the two paddles simultaneously.
